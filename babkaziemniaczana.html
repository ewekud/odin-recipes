    <h3>How to Make Latkes</h3>
    <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make these easy potato latkes:
        
            Shred the potatoes and wring out excess moisture with a cheesecloth.
            Mix two cups of the potatoes with the flour, salt, egg, and diced onion.
            Fry spoonfuls of the potato mixture in hot oil, pressing down to form patties.
            Cook until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels. 
    

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 medium russet potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated onion</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>¼ cup peanut oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice peeled potatoes and run through a food processor fitted with the grater attachment. Place shredded potatoes in a cheesecloth and wring, extracting as much moisture as possible.</li>
            <li>Measure 2 cups shredded, drained potatoes and place into a medium bowl; save any extra for another use. Add egg, flour, onion, and salt, and stir until well combined. </li>
            <li>Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Place large spoonfuls of potato mixture into the hot oil, pressing down on them to form 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick patties. Cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side.</li>
            <li>Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain while you cook any remaining latkes. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
