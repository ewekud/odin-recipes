    <img src="../images/fish.jpeg">
    <h3>How to Make it</h3>
    <p>Here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make fish and chips at home:

        · Make the chips by slicing and frying the potatoes.
        · Make the batter by mixing the flour, baking powder, seasonings, milk, and egg.
        · Dredge the fish in batter.
        · Fry the fish until golden brown.
        · Fry the potatoes a second time, then serve alongside the fried fish.
    

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into strips</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li> ½ pounds cod fillets</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place sliced potatoes in a medium bowl and cover with cold water.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper together in a separate medium bowl. Add milk and egg; stir until batter is smooth. Let stand for 20 minutes. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large pot or electric skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

            <li>Dredge cod in batter, one piece at a time, and place in hot oil. Fry fish in batches until golden brown on all sides; drain on paper towels. Monitor oil temperature, increasing the heat as needed to maintain 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fry potatoes again in hot oil until crisp, 1 to 2 minutes; drain on paper towels.</li>
